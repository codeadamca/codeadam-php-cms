# PHP CMS for codeadam.ca

This repository stores the vanilla PHP version of the codeadam.ca CMS. This CMS is based off of my basic [PHP CMS](https://github.com/codeadamca/php-cms) created for the intention of learning basic PHP and CRUD concepts. 

The website is visible in it's current state at [https://codeadam.ca](https://codeadam.ca).
